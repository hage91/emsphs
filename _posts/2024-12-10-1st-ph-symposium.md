From August to November, five international project groups collaborated on independent projects centered around port-Hamiltonian Systems (pHS), addressing topics including:

- Linear Optimal Control for Infinite-Dimensional pHS
-  Dissipativity and Model Predictive Control
-  Differential-Algebraic Equations
-  Eddy Current Brakes and Maxwell’s Equations

These efforts culminated in the 1st pH Symposium, held at CVJM Bundeshöhe, Wuppertal. Over the course of four days, the groups presented their findings, accompanied by talks from guest speakers:
- Thavamani Govindaraj (TU Ilmenau)
- Attila Karsai (TU Berlin)
- Antoine Bendimerad-Hohl (SUPAERO, Toulouse)

as well as a hybrid PH Seminar talk given by Timo Reis (TU Ilmenau) on energy optimal control and pH system nodes. 
The event fostered knowledge exchange and discussions on the latest developments in the field. We thank all participants, speakers, and project leaders for their contributions, that can be found here.

Plans are already underway to make this symposium a regular event, with the next gathering scheduled for January 12–16, 2025, in Wuppertal.
