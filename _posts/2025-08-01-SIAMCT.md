Karim Cherifi and Hannes Gernandt (University of Wuppertal) organized a minisymposium on "Port-Hamiltonian Systems" at the SIAM CT in Montréal. We are happy that many members of the EMS TAG travelled to Canada and contributed a total of 10 talks. Furthermore, there was a related minitutorial on "Partial-Differential Algebraic Equations: Dissipativity and Control Design" by Hannes Gernandt, Mehmet Erbay (University of Wuppertal) and Ala' Alalabi (North Carolina State University).
