Workshop of the Doctoral College "Port Hamiltonian Systems: modelling, numerics and control"
will take place from 10-12 March 2026  in Wuppertal.

The doctoral college, funded by the Franco-German University DFH-UFA (CDFA-05-22) is aimed at PhD students from Germany, France and the partner countries the Netherlands (since 2022) and Austria (from 2026) working on the development and application of structured, energy-based methods for modeling, numerical approximation and control of multi-physical systems. The doctoral college CDFA-PHS 
builds on the long-standing collaboration between research groups in the participating countries 
provides an institutional framework for structured doctoral training, and 
promotes the mobility of young researchers by providing financial support for research stays in the partner countries.
We are a network, which is open to PhD students and colleagues from neighboring disciplines of engineering and mathematics.
