From March 12-13 the first Workshop Women in port-Hamiltonian Systems takes place at the University of Wuppertal. The Workshop is insprired by the German conference series [Women in Optimization](https://www.opt.uni-wuppertal.de/de/wio2026/) and provides a platform for female researchers to showcase their work and achievements, facilitate new contacts and collaborations and promote a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the research community. A particular highlight of the workshop is the opening of the exhibition 
together with the sister exhibition “Women in PHS”. Both exhibitions portray female mathematicians. Although the first is already established, the sister exhibition focusses on the female mathematicians of the CRC 1701 Port-Hamiltonian systems.
