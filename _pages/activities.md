 supported by the Franco-Bavarian University Cooperation Center BayFrance, 
 coordinated by P. Kotyczka, B. Maschke and J. Scherpen, 
 

**Tools and Repositiries**

- [Benchmark collection for port-Hamiltonian systems](https://algopaul.github.io/PortHamiltonianBenchmarkSystems/), 
 initiated by B. Lohmann, V. Mehrmann, T. Moser, P. Schwerdtner, and M. Voigt 
 
- [SCRIMP](https://g-haine.github.io/scrimp/) (Simulation and ContRol of Interactions in Multi-Physics),  
 a python collection of methods and classes for the structure-preserving discretization and simulation of multi-physics models, 
 using the formalism of port-Hamiltonian systems, 
 initiated by M. Fourni√©, G. Haine, F. Monteghetti, and X. Vasseur
