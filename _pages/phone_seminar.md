**Title:**  Port-Hamiltonian systems: algebraic, geometric and operator theoretic representations

**Abstract:** Different representations of dissipative Hamiltonian and 
port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations (DAE) systems are 
presented and compared. Using global geometric and algebraic points of 
view, translations between the different representations are 
presented. The results also apply in the Hilbert space setting of 
linear operator equations. Characterizations are also derived when a 
general DAE system can be transformed into one of these structured 
representations. Approaches for computing the structural information and 
the described transformations are derived that can be directly 
implemented as numerical methods. The results are demonstrated with a 
large number of examples.
